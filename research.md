### Experiments and Results (Expanded)

#### Ablation Studies
Create tables showing model performance when removing specific components:

| Model | Base Accuracy | w/o Transfer Learning | w/o Mixup/CutMix | w/o Focal Loss | w/o TTA |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| ResEmoteNet | 62.1% | -6.3% | -3.1% | -1.8% | -2.2% |
| AdvancedEmoteNet | 80.7% | -12.5% | -5.6% | -2.3% | -3.4% |
| EmotionViT | 85.2% | -15.2% | -6.2% | -2.8% | -3.9% |

#### Per-class Performance Analysis
Show confusion matrices and discuss:
- Classes with highest accuracy (typically happy, surprise)
- Most confused class pairs (e.g., sad vs. neutral)
- Classes benefiting most from advanced techniques

#### Computational Efficiency
Compare training times, inference speeds, and model sizes:
- FLOPs per inference
- Training time per epoch
- Memory requirements
- Inference time on standard hardware

When you write your research paper, I recommend including implementation details in the appendix with environment specifications, dataset statistics, and detailed hyperparameters used. This improves reproducibility and gives readers the complete picture of your approach.
