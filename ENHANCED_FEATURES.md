# 🚀 Enhanced GReFEL: Advanced Features & Improvements

## 🎨 **Enhanced Data Augmentation (Face-Preserving)**

### 1. **FacePreservingAugmentation Class**
- **Facial Emphasis**: Enhances key facial regions (eyes, mouth) using subtle sharpening kernels
- **Emotion Enhancement**: Applies contrast/brightness changes that emphasize emotion features
- **Lighting Variation**: Simulates different lighting conditions while preserving facial structure
- **Probability**: 60% chance of applying advanced augmentation

### 2. **CutMix for Facial Emotions**
- **Face-Aware Cutting**: Avoids central 30% of image where main facial features are located
- **Peripheral Focus**: Cuts from top/bottom/left/right regions to preserve expressions
- **Adaptive Lambda**: Adjusts mixing ratio based on actual cut area
- **Probability**: 50% chance during training

### 3. **Enhanced Standard Augmentation**
```python
# Increased augmentation parameters for better emotion recognition
- RandomRotation: (-8, 8) degrees (increased from (-5, 5))
- ColorJitter: brightness=0.25, contrast=0.25 (increased for emotion emphasis)
- RandomAffine: translate=(0.08, 0.08), scale=(0.92, 1.08)
- RandomPerspective: distortion_scale=0.15 (increased)
- GaussianBlur: sigma=(0.1, 0.8) (increased range)
- RandomErasing: p=0.15, scale=(0.02, 0.12) (increased)
```

## 🏗️ **Architecture Enhancements**

### 1. **EnhancedGeometryAwareModule**
- **Multi-Head Attention**: 8-head attention between features and anchors
- **Adaptive Anchor Refinement**: Learnable anchor updates with bounded refinement
- **Feature Enhancement**: LayerNorm + FFN with GELU activation
- **Learnable Loss Weights**: Adaptive geometry loss weighting
- **Improved Stability**: Better initialization and residual connections

### 2. **EnhancedReliabilityBalancingModule**
- **Multi-Layer Network**: Deeper reliability estimation (4 layers)
- **Monte Carlo Dropout**: Uncertainty estimation through multiple forward passes
- **Confidence Estimation**: Multiple confidence measures (entropy, max prob, prediction confidence)
- **Feature Refinement**: Reliability-based feature enhancement
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Combines 4 different reliability factors

### 3. **Enhanced Loss Function (EnhancedGReFELLoss)**
- **Adaptive Loss Weights**: Learnable geometry and reliability weights
- **Temperature Scaling**: Learnable temperature for reliability weighting
- **Improved Soft Label Handling**: Better KL divergence computation
- **Reliability Targeting**: Encourages high reliability for confident predictions
- **Loss Clamping**: Prevents loss explosion (max 10.0)

## 📊 **Training Improvements**

### 1. **CutMix Integration**
```python
# Training loop with CutMix
- 50% chance of applying CutMix during training
- Face-aware cutting that preserves main facial features
- Proper loss interpolation for mixed samples
- Handles both soft and hard labels correctly
```

### 2. **Enhanced Loss Handling**
```python
# New loss dictionary format
loss_dict = {
    'total_loss': combined_loss,
    'classification_loss': ce_or_kl_loss,
    'geometry_loss': adaptive_geo_loss,
    'reliability_loss': adaptive_reliability_loss,
    'avg_reliability': reliability_score.mean(),
    'avg_confidence': max_probs.mean()
}
```

### 3. **Improved Optimizer Setup**
```python
# Different learning rates for different components
optimizer = optim.AdamW([
    {'params': backbone_params, 'lr': args.lr * 0.1},  # Lower LR for backbone
    {'params': head_params, 'lr': args.lr},            # Higher LR for new modules
    {'params': criterion.parameters(), 'lr': args.lr}  # LR for loss parameters
])
```

## 🔧 **Key Technical Improvements**

### 1. **Numerical Stability**
- Feature normalization in all modules
- Gradient norm monitoring and clipping
- NaN/Inf detection and handling
- Conservative initialization (gain=0.1)
- Loss clamping to prevent explosion

### 2. **Memory Efficiency**
- Efficient multi-head attention implementation
